  "property-description" "Unrelaxed potential energy of formation of a monovacancy in a (possibly multispecies) infinite host crystal lattice at a given temperature and stress state relative to a given infinite monoatomic reference lattice ('reservoir') at the same temperature and stress state. The host and reservoir structures are expressed as AFLOW prototype labels and their corresponding free parameters. Monovacancies for all unique Wyckoff sites are computed."

Each row corresponds to a structure in the test, i.e. a test computing a property of a single crystal will only have one row, while something like a transformation between two pre-determined crystals would have two rows, and so on. Within each row, there may be multiple columns in the case when multiple initial structures converged to a single final structure during this test or one of its upstream dependencies. Because KIM Property values must be regular arrays, rows will be padded with empty strings to match the longest row."
